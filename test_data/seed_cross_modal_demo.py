"""Seed a deliberately cross-modal knowledge base for demoing /query.

This does NOT call Whisper/Gemini and needs no API keys -- it writes
`KnowledgeNode` records straight into the same persistent ChromaDB store the
API uses, so `uvicorn main:app` (or `test_pipeline.py`) can query them
immediately.

The scenario is designed so that no single modality alone answers the demo
question -- the evidence is deliberately split:

  - video transcript (spoken) names the failure mode but not the fix
  - a video frame's visual_summary shows the retry/backoff diagram that IS
    the fix, at a different timestamp than the transcript segment
  - a PDF page gives the numeric backoff policy (base delay, max retries)
  - a screenshot image shows the resulting dashboard graph after the fix
    shipped, with OCR text of the annotation

Demo question: "How did the team fix the checkout service's timeout
failures, and what does the fix look like in production?"

A text-only / single-modality system can find *one* of these fragments.
Answering it fully requires combining the spoken explanation (video audio),
the diagram (video frame / visual_summary), the numeric policy (PDF page
text), and the after-the-fact proof (image OCR + visual_summary) -- i.e.
genuine cross-modal retrieval, not just OCR-to-text-to-vector-search.

This scenario mirrors the real sample files bundled under
``test_data/samples/`` (which you can upload through the actual API — see
``test_data/upload_samples.py``); this script instead writes equivalent
knowledge directly into Chroma so the demo works instantly, with no API
keys and no running server.

Run:
    python test_data/seed_cross_modal_demo.py
